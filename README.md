# Pure Dungeon Game

A small browser-based dungeon game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to hone basic web development skills.

## About

This is a simple dungeon game that runs entirely in the browser. The project serves as a learning exercise for fundamental web technologies including HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript game logic. Players navigate through a dungeon environment, encounter enemies, collect items, and manage their character's health and inventory.

## Features

- **Character Control**: Move your soul reaper character through the dungeon
- **Combat System**: Engage in battles with enemies
- **Item Collection**: Gather coins, shields, and soul orbs
- **Health Management**: Monitor your character's soul energy
- **Inventory System**: Manage collected items
- **Sprite Animations**: Animated characters with different states (idle, walking, attacking, dying)

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Game structure and layout
- **CSS**: Styling, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, character movement, and interactions
- **PNG Sprites**: Character and item graphics
